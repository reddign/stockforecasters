I look at stocks and the market in my free time, but never know when or if I should invest in certain stocks.
 Being able to see the trend line and make a decision based off of it is what I am looking for in a stock forecaster.
  Knowing when the best time to invest would also be helpful. Do I invest once it starts dropping or when it just begins to rise? 
  I only look at big companies on the stock market because I donâ€™t trust smaller companies to be able to grow on the market.
A webpage that would help me make decisions would be very useful.
